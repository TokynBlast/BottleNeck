## Setup
Make sure your target is either on Linux or Windows.
Support for other OSes will be added at some point.

I don't know how to compile, or run ASM yet.
Once, I do, I will put it here how to!

## LEGAL
<a style='color:red'>I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT THIS IS USED FOR.</a>

## Purpose
This is for my OWN education.<br>
If something happnens to an OS, it is the USERS (As defined in the License) fault.

<sub>This was made as a project of boredom.<br>With this creation, I will know a bit of ASM.</sub>
